Former architect turned full stack developer, because designing buildings was too Static for me. I'm passionate about creating dynamic web applications that are both functional and visually pleasing.

## Skills 

* JavaScript
* Typescript
* React.js
* Node.js
* Three.js
* React Three Fiber
* HTML/CSS
* Express js 
* KOA 
* SQL 
* non-SQL 

With a background in architecture, I bring a unique perspective to my work as a full stack developer. My experience with 3D design programs such as Autodesk 3ds Max and SketchUp has given me a strong foundation in graphics programming, which has allowed me to dive into web-based 3D technologies like Three.js and React Three Fiber.

I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in these areas, as well as other programming languages and tools, to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in the industry.
